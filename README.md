ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the Python Snake-Water-Gun Game! ðŸŽ®

This is a simple and fun Python implementation of the classic Snake, Water, Gun game where you play against the computer.

## Game Rules

- **Snake** beats **Water**.
- **Water** beats **Gun**.
- **Gun** beats **Snake**.
- If both the player and the computer make the same choice, it's a **Draw**.
  
Choices are:

- **Snake**: Represented by `1`.
- **Water**: Represented by `-1`.
- **Gun**: Represented by `0`.

You can play multiple rounds and at any point type 'Exit' to quit the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `snake_water_gun.py`.
2. Enter your choice by typing:
   - `snake` for Snake
   - `water` for Water
   - `gun` for Gun
   - `exit` to quit the game.
3. The computer will make a random choice and the result will be shown.
4. If you win, you will see "ðŸŽ‰ You Win! Hurray!". If you lose, you will see "ðŸ˜¢ You Lose! Better luck next time!".
5. If both you and the computer choose the same, itâ€™s a draw.
